## Everyday Carry

### On Body

- Phone: [iPhone 16 Pro](#iphone-16-pro)
- Watch: [Garmin Forerunner 255s](#garmin-foreunner-255s)
- Authorization: Keyring with car fob, bike lock key, apartment fob, yubi key, and airtag.
- Authorization: 3-card magsafe card holder with driver's license, bus pass, and USBank Smartly credit card.
- Authorization: Work badge on fob. I carry this separately from the other cards since the badge readers are sensitive to other cards.

### Packed

- Backpack: [CTactical CT15](#ctactical-ct15)
- Personal Laptop: 13" Macbook Air M2
- Work Laptop: 13" Macbook Air M3
- Bike Lock: Kryptonite Evolution U-Lock
- Earbuds: Soundcore Aerofit Pro
- Glasses with case
- Sunscreen
- Sunglasses with case
- Tech Pouch: Aer Slim Pouch for tech: an Anker 100W GaN Charger, Anker 10k mAh magnetic power bank, Crucial X10 Pro 4TB SSD, a Garmin Watch cable, wired earbuds and 0.5, 3, and 10 ft USB-C to USB-C cables
- Running Gear: Black Diamond Sprinter 500 Headlamp, gym clothes, running shoes

### Rationale

I'll generally take my phone, watch and auth whenever I leave my home. When I'm commuting by ebike, I'll bring my u lock, which generally means I'm bringing my backpack.

## Specific Items

### Bags
#### CTactical CT15
A custom version of CTactical's CT15 V3.0 from a Facebook group buy, nicknamed Kevin/Obsidian. After getting this pack, I stopped searching for new packs because I love it so much.

- The size is great to carry around every day. Anything smaller and an a tote or sling would be more appropriate. I've also used it as my only bag for a 2 week trip with no problems.
- I like the understated aesthetic. It's shaped like a classic rectangle, similar to GoRuck's GR1, and has no logos.
- It's made of  Ultra 200tx material, which is technically great (light and waterproof) and is crinkly and feels like it'll wear well like leather or denim.
- The main compartment opens completely clamshell, which allows for easy packing and unpacking. A TSA agent complimented this once during an inspection.
- There's a top quick access pocket and two side water bottle holders that zip away when not in use. These are great to access things while on the go. I had a previous version of the bag without these, and they make a world of a difference.
- The laptop area is padded and has a side zip for dedicated laptop access. This saves weight over a dedicated laptop compartment. Sometimes I forget to close the side zips and the laptop falls out.

### Tech
#### Iphone 16 Pro
After using Google Pixels and Nexuses exclusively since 2012, I finally gave in to the ecosystem. I tried my best.

#### Garmin Foreunner 255s
A 41mm smartwatch, Garmin's smallest and lightest. It's the last one with an e-ink style display, that saves battery life and is visible in the sun.


## Change Log
- 2025-05-29: Added an Airtag to my keyring.
- 2025-05-29: Upgraded the USB-A Garmin Watch cable with a USB-C Garmin Watch cable. The slight downside is this might compete with the 2 USB-C slots of the Anker 100 GaN Charger.
