## Everyday Carry

### On Body

- Phone: iPhone 16 Pro
- Watch: Garmin Forerunner 255s
- Authorization: Keyring with car fob, bike lock key, apartment fob, yubi key, and airtag.
- Authorization: 3-card magsafe card holder with driver's license, bus pass, and USBank Smartly credit card.
- Authorization: Work badge on fob. I carry this separately from the other cards since the badge readers are sensitive to other cards.

### Packed

- Backpack: CTactical CT15 V3 Kevin/Obsidian
- Personal Laptop: 13" Macbook Air M2
- Work Laptop: 13" Macbook Air M3
- Bike Lock: Kryptonite Evolution U-Lock
- Earbuds: Soundcore Aerofit Pro

- Tech Pouch: Aer Slim Pouch for tech: an Anker 100W GaN Charger, Anker 10k mAh magnetic power bank, Crucial X10 Pro 4TB SSD, a Garmin Watch cable, wired earbuds and 0.5, 3, and 10 ft USB-C to USB-C cables
- Running Gear: Black Diamond Sprinter 500 Headlamp, gym clothes, running shoes

### Rationale

I'll generally take my phone, watch and auth whenever I leave my home. When I'm commuting by ebike, I'll bring my u lock, which generally means I'm bringing my backpack.

## Specific Items



## Change Log
- 2025-05-29: Added an Airtag to my keyring.
- 2025-05-29: Upgraded the USB-A Garmin Watch cable with a USB-C Garmin Watch cable. The slight downside is this might compete with the 2 USB-C slots of the Anker 100 GaN Charger.
