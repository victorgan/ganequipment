## Specific Items

### Bags
#### CTactical CT15

**Perfect Item**. A custom version of CTactical's CT15 V3.0 from a Facebook group buy, nicknamed Kevin/Obsidian. After getting this pack, I stopped searching for new packs because I love it so much.

- The size is great to carry around every day. Anything smaller and an a tote or sling would be more appropriate. I've also used it as my only bag for a 2 week trip with no problems.
- I like the understated aesthetic. It's shaped like a classic rectangle, similar to GoRuck's GR1, and has no logos.
- It's made of  Ultra 200tx material, which is technically great (light and waterproof) and is crinkly and feels like it'll wear well like leather or denim.
- The main compartment opens completely clamshell, which allows for easy packing and unpacking. A TSA agent complimented this once during an inspection.
- There's a top quick access pocket and two side water bottle holders that zip away when not in use. These are great to access things while on the go. I had a previous version of the bag without these, and they make a world of a difference.
- The laptop area is padded and has a side zip for dedicated laptop access. This saves weight over a dedicated laptop compartment. Sometimes I forget to close the side zips and the laptop falls out.

### Tech
#### Iphone 16 Pro
**Perfect Item** After using Google Pixels and Nexuses exclusively since 2012, I finally gave in to the ecosystem. I tried my best. I wish it was a bit smaller.

#### Garmin Foreunner 255s

**Perfect Item**. A 41mm smartwatch, Garmin's smallest and lightest. It's the last one with an e-ink style display, that saves battery life and is visible in the sun.

I've been trying mechanical watches for daily wear, but it's hard to beat the convenience of not having to set the time every day. I also considered the new Pebble time, but the Garmin is just too integrated with running features.

### Clothes
#### Patagonia Airshed Pro

**Perfect Item**. This acts as a sun hoodie, running shirt and windshirt combined. In high exertion hot weather, the elastic on the sleeves let you bunch them up securely and the zipper goes down very deep. It's extremely breathable; often more breathable than polyester T-shirts. I can usually run in this until 5C, since it blocks enough wind to keep me warm when moving.

In theory, this combined with the Patagonia Nano Air Ultralight can be all you need until around 5C, both running and stationary.

- Wear the Airshed by itself while active or stationary.
- Put on the Nano Air Ultralight when it gets colder.
- Put the Airshed over the Nano Air Ultralight when it gets even colder for more wind resistance.

The downside is the color (Wispy Green) is a little see through.

#### Patagonia Nano Air Ultralight

**Perfect Item**. This is an 'active insulation' pullover that is kind of ridiculous, because there's almost no insulation in it. I sized up to a medium because it's a slim fit, and now it looks baggy in a trendy way.

I quite like that it's a pullover, since it reduces bulk in the hood area. It's comfy and light enough to wear casually.

### Shoes
#### Nike Pegasus 41

**Perfect Item**. Packing running shoes takes a ton of space, and I wanted a pair of primarily casual shoes that I can also run in. Nike recently came out with a colorway (Sail/Blue Tint/Wolf Grey/Anthracite FD2722-113) that looked a lot like the Eliot Tracksmith's but less pretentious, and fit the bill well. I actually like the look of it more than the New Balance 574s and 327s that I was previously using as casual shoes, so even if I'm not running I'll wear them.

## Change Log
- 2025-05-29: Replaced the tearing Maduka Men's Pro Shorts with Patagonia Men's 7-in Strider Pro Shorts. The Patagonia shorts are more technical, lighter and pack down smaller, but they're not as comfortable - I wouldn't sleep in them.
- 2025-05-29: Upgraded the Black Diamond Access Down Hoody to the [Patagonia Nano Air Ultralight](#patagonia-nano-air-ultralight).
- 2025-05-29: Replaced the Asics Superblast 2 + casual shoe combo for traveling with the [Nike Pegasus 41](#nike-pegasus-41) running shoes.
- 2025-05-29: Added an Airtag to my keyring, using a keychain holder from Elevation Labs. I now have 5 airtags: car, ebike, luggage, backpack, and keys.
- 2025-05-29: Upgraded the USB-A Garmin Watch cable with a USB-C Garmin Watch cable. The slight downside is this might compete with the 2 USB-C slots of the Anker 100 GaN Charger.

## Prospective Purchases
- 2025-05-29: [Darn Tough Socks](https://darntough.com/collections/men/products/mens-merino-wool-element-micro-crew-lightweight-running-socks?variant=42474173956282) in white, to match the Pegasus shoes.

## Retired Items
